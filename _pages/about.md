# 👨‍💻 About Me
I am currently a undergraduate student at **Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)**. Since June 2025, I have been serving as a **Remote Research Intern** at **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**, where I am privileged to work with [Dr. Xiaojun Jia](https://xiaojunjia.github.io/). My academic journey is driven by a commitment to building robust and secure AI systems.

My research interests are primarily in the field of **AI Security**, with a particular focus on:
* **LLM and Agent Security**: Including jailbreaking attacks on LLMs, adversarial prompt optimization, defensive alignment, security of LLM-based agents against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI), and so on.
* **AI for Security**: intrusion detection syetem (IDS)…
I am also maintaining a broad interest in emerging frontiers of AI security and am open to exploring novel research directions.

**📣 Currently, I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities starting in 2026 to further explore the frontiers of AI Safety and trustworthy machine learning. 🥺**
